A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

Since this value is not related to classification/ features of the entry itself, it doesn't make sense to use for classification purposes. Further, more than 50% of the values in this column are unique, so it is not particularly useful for classification.|\n",

For example, HS-grad and Some-college are closer than 7th-8th and Masters, and this \"ordering\" can be captured using ordinal encoding. |\n",

If we violated the Golden Rule and used test data for training our model, we would actually get a slightly better classifier since we are training it using more data.
