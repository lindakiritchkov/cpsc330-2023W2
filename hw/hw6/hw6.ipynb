There are other richer and more expressive representations of text, and we are going to use one such representation in this homework. We will call it **sentence embedding representation**. We'll use [sentence transformer](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) to extract these representations. At this point it's enough to know that this is an alternative representation of text which usually works better than simple bag-of-words representation. We will talk a bit more about embedding representations in the coming weeks. To use sentence transformer, you need to install `sentence-transformers` in the course conda environment to run the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code below to create sentence embedding representation of documents in our toy corpus. \n",
    "2. Cluster the documents with this representation (`emb_sents`) and `KMeans` with the following arguments: \n",
    "    - `random_state=42` (for reproducibility)\n",
    "    - `n_clusters`=the number of clusters you identified in 1.1\n",
    "3. Store the labels as a list in `kmeans_emb_labels`"
